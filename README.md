# Project Zero - Life 

Life is a tomagotchi-inspired game in which the player is paramount to Earth sustaining life from year 500 million when life began to present day (year 4.54 billion). I created this game in hopes that the player can appreciate how extensive Earth's history truly is.

### User Stories 
- As a user of Life I want the planet's health to be three components essential to actual life  on earthsuch as oxygen, water, and sunlight so the game can feel more realistic to me.
- As a user of Life I want to be able to play a part in the overall health of earth so I feel more than just an observer. 
- As a user of Life I want to watch my Earth visibly change over time so I can see the blood, sweat, and tears of my effort in real time. 
- As a user of Life I want to be able to incorporate the real timeline of earth's history so the player is aware of earth's actual long history.
- As a user of Life I want the time to be in large increments such as 100 million so the player does not have to wait an extremely long time to successfully finish the game.
- As a user of Life I want to visibly see the health components of Earth so I am aware of the current condition and what it requires to flourish. 

### Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery

### APPROACH TAKEN 
Phase 1 
- Completed 90% of the HTML then added borders/different bakground colors to all the CSS elements to easily identify them on the page, and added the primary GIF which helped identify the change over time was successful in the next phase.
Phase 2 
- Created the JavaScript utilizing jQuery. Updated the HTML to include additional elements.
Phase 3 
- Completed the CSS and revisted Javascript to add animations. 

### Unsolved Problems
- Creating an input to get the user's name with a max number of characters on the landing screen which could be submitted without affecting other elements of the page. A work around I used was creating a prompt before the screen loads but this reduces the overall user experience. 

### Version 
- Life 1.0
