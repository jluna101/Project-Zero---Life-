# EXPLANATION OF WHAT THE PROJECT IS AND WHY YOU MADE IT

Life is a tomagotchi-inspired game in which the player is paramount in Earth sustaining life through the various ages in our 4.54 billion year history to the present day. I created this game in hopes that the player can appreciate how extensive Earth's history truly is. 

### User Stories 

As a user of Life I want the planet's health to be components essential to real life such as oxygen, water, and sunlight so the game can feel more realistic to me.

As a user of Life I want to be able to play a part in the overall health of earth so I feel more than just an observer. 

As a user of Life I want to watch my Earth visibly change over time so I can see the blood, sweat, and tears of my effort in real time. 

As a user of Life I want to be able to incorporate the real timeline of earth's history so the player is aware of earth's actual long history.

As a user of Life I want the time to be in large increments such as 100 million so the player does not have to wait an extremely long time to successfully finish the game.

As a user of Life I want to visibly see the health components of Earth so I am aware of the current condition and what it requires to flourish.
